# To Do List

In our increasingly complex and ever-evolving business landscape demand is constantly growing for simple, intuitive, and lightly space-themed task management software. 

Are you tired of your current To Do List solutions letting you down during crucial moments? Well, look no further than the To Do List app!

Now, every rose has its thorns and the To Do List app is no different. 

Early user testing has indicated that the app is riddled with bugs and borderline unusable... This is where you come in!

### The Assignment

This project features a collection of introduced bugs. Your task is to find & fix 6 issues (intentional or unintentional), and briefly describe your rationale for the change.

The scope of this assignment is limited to the `.tsx` files. You're welcome to change things to your liking, but running the development server (following the [steps below](#getting-started)) is expected to work with no additional warnings or errors, and only changes to the `.tsx` files will be considered.

**Let's make this To Do List a To Done List!**

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

`npm install`

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
